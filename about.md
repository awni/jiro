This blog is intended to help anyone master machine learning through consistent
*practice*.

A set of tags is associated with each problem. For example problems related to
understanding neural networks will be tagged with `neural networks`.

A difficulty rating will also be associated with each problem on a scale of 0
to 5 with 5 being the most difficult. A difficulty rating of 0 is intended to
take a few minutes to solve while a difficulty rating of 5 may take an hour or
require a highly non-obvious insight.

Problem contributions, corrections and comments are welcome. Please file an
issue or pull request at the [project
repository](https://github.com/awni/jiro).
