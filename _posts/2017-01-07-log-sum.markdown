### Problem ###

Sometimes we need to sum two probabilities that are in log-space. If we let
$$a$$ and $$b$$ be the two log probabilities then the straight-forward method
to compute the sum of the probabilities in log-space, $$p$$, would be 

\\[ p = \log (e^a + e^b). \\]

This can result in numerical instability (underflow) when $$a$$ or $$b$$ are
large and negative.

Show that another way to compute $$p$$ is given by

\\[ p = \max\\{a, b\\} + \log (1 + e^{-\|a - b\|}). \\]

The function $$\log(1 + x)$$ can be computed efficiently and precisely in 
C++ with [log1p].
